Here is my updating.

What I'm trying to get going is adding a new page, a contact me .html file.

I'm also going to fix the one that's at the bottom of this one.

OK, so compiling swim news, right, got it.

Here's a video and article about the 2024 Olympics that are to be held in Los Angeles, CA, USA.

This is my first post. Today in the news I found several articles

(http://people.com/sports/olympian-amanda-beard-encourages-swim-education/)

In the referenced article, Amanda Beard goes on to talk about many facets of learning

that are attributed to swimming early, "Attention parents looking for a way to jumpstart your kids’ emotional, intellectual and physical growth: Olympic gold medal-winning swimming sensation Amanda Beard has a message for you.

“Get them in the water and teach them to swim,” says Beard, whose recently-opened Beard Swim Co., a swim school in Gig Harbor, Washington, has just become the first such facility recognized by the International Swimming Hall of Fame."

This high recommendation of swimming early in life only re-iterates the importance of teaching young people
how to swim.
