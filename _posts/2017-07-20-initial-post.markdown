This is my first post. Today in the news I found several articles

http://people.com/sports/olympian-amanda-beard-encourages-swim-education/

In the referenced article, Amanda Beard goes on to talk about many facets of learning

that are attributed to swimming early, "Attention parents looking for a way to jumpstart your kids’ emotional, intellectual and physical growth: Olympic gold medal-winning swimming sensation Amanda Beard has a message for you.

“Get them in the water and teach them to swim,” says Beard, whose recently-opened Beard Swim Co., a swim school in Gig Harbor, Washington, has just become the first such facility recognized by the International Swimming Hall of Fame."

This high recommendation of swimming early in life only re-iterates the importance of teaching young peopple
how to swim.
