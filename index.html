  <h1>Welcome to Swim News Compiler</h1>

    <p> This website will have 5 links per week to events
      that happen in the world of swimming.
      I compile them throughout the week and on Friday,
      send an email of the weeks links.

      <br>The following link is the list of all of the links
          with a brief review</br>
